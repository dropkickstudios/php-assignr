php-assignr
===========

This is a starter example showing how to use the [assignr.com API](http://assignr.com/help) to pull data from your assignr.com site using PHP. 

Your web server must support PHP scripting.

### get-games.php

* Copy the get-games.php file to your web server
* The web server should be able to write to the directory.  
* Modify the $username and $api_key variables 
* Review the $search_criteria variable. You can limit the games displayed by using the [assignr.com search language](http://assignr.com/help/games/search_games).
* Modify CSS styles as needed
